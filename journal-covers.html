<p><b>I was nine years old the first time I kept a journal, on my way up to Montréal, Canada, from the suburbs of Boston.</b> Dad drove, and my kid brother and grandmother were along for the ride. Grandma's people had been from Quebec, though I was unaware of that at the time. The cover of that journal is as unprepossessing as it gets.</p>
<p>Since then the covers have been anything from 100% utilitarian, to 100% very possessing. There was a period when I made my own journals — designed the layout, printed out the pages, created covers from both found materials as well as from posters I'd designed, chopping them up. Even built in pockets in the back, to carry stamps, notes, ephemera, and added maps.</p>
<p>Then there was the period when i used Write-In-the-Rain® journals, as do any number of those whose work takes them out in the field, with all kinds of inclement weather.</p>
<p>At some time — I suppose I could look at the date — I found the Leurmerwhatever they are called, and have used them for more than a decade. The pages are blank, no rules. Not great paper for watercolors, but then when I started using them, I was not doing watercolors, but instead, any sketches may have been colored pencil or colored markers.</p>
<p>Here, some of my greatest hits, the places I've lingered long enough to do more than take a photo, but to commit some quality of line, and maybe color, to the page.</p>

<p><b>the covers:</b></p>
<p>When photographing the journals for an installation, a great pal, who’s creative instincts I admire, suggested printing some of the covers large, as posters.</p>
<p>So there you have it.</p>
