<p>The work here has been inspired by my journal sketches. The sketches, done for myself, and not a public audience, are to lock a place in my mind, in a way a photo does not.</p>
<p>These pieces are meant to extrapolate and expand upon what it was that first made me stop to take the time to commit a place to paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploration involves so many aspects: not only what we see and feel — color, form, weather — but also what we know and learn — cultures, geography, terrain. Which means these pieces may be informed by the very maps that lead me to these places, or details based on local motifs.</p>
<p>If the journal pages, sketches, are meant for personal pleasure, these pieces are made for others, for those who may have visited these places, or those who imagine doing so one day.</p>
