<p><b>Exploration.</b> A career spent in graphic design, serving others. That rare balance of theory and practice, running an acclaimed studio and teaching in both graduate and undergraduate programs across the U.S., México, Guatemala. Clients in any number of arenas, from Vietnam to Malawi, San Francisco to Tel Aviv. Back in school, studying design, we were told our work wasn't meant for museums. Still, it’s found its way into collections in the U.S.,&nbsp; Mexico, Germany, and in an unlikely turn of events, the Pompidou Center, in Paris. Life is funny, no?<br></p>
<p>The process has been steeped in identity, listening to people tell their stories, trying to understand those people and their places, and what makes them special, genuine. What makes them unique. The personal process&nbsp; — started as a child, long before hints of a professional career — has meant putting those findings in journals that span decades and continents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, a career spent in graphic design, after having worked with researchers documenting some of the oldest visual communication in North America, as well as rubbing shoulders with The Legends. That, while studying at Massachusetts College of Art + Design, and after studying at Berklee College of Music. Raised in the Boston area, schooled in the Transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau, with Concord's Walden Pond as lifelong swimming hole, I moved to Texas to find other swimming holes, to explore as many directions as possible. Sometimes on motorcycle, sometimes on the ground in the rain, with just a blanket overhead. And sometimes the only blanket being stars overhead, and if I’m particularly fortunate, with the sound of a creek, river, or ocean to lull me to sleep.<br></p>

<p><b>THIS work:</b> The journals, the watercolors, done for myself. But I was asked by too many people, to share. The mixed media, inspired and informed by the personal explorations from the journals.</p>
